This package extends GIFgraph. It's allow generates HTML map text 
for following graphics objects GIFgraph::pie, GIFgraph::bars,
GIFgraph::point and GIFgraph::linespoints

To install, first install GIFgraph module. 
Then cd to the directory that contains this README file 
and type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL

If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default
location then type something like:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

Then to build run make

    make

If you have write access to the install directory (or the one
specified by PREFIX) then you can now type:

    make install

Presuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you
are now ready to use GIFgraph::Map. Enjoy!
