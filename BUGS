! In some browsers JavaScript code for showing information in status line 
  can work incorrectly. It must contain command 'return true' for success,
  I add ones.

! Default think that %x, %y, %s and %p is floating numbers, therefore
  if it decimal numbers, for example 3 or 19, that you get 3.000000 or
  19.000000 as result. Now default think that its decimal numbers.
! If in some Hrefs you use JavaScript code and newWindow set to TRUE, 
  that for them will be open new navigator window too. But often is 
  dose not necessary. Now if Hrefs contains JavaScript code, that
  newWindow is ignored.
